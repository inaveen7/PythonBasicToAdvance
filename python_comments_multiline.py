#program to understand the multi-line comments in python

'''
Since python will ignore string literals which are not assigned to a variable,you can add a multi-;ine string (Triple quotes) in your code,
and place your comments inside it.
'''

'''
As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, python read the code, but later ignore it,
and you have made a multiline comment.
'''

'''

This is a comment
written in
more than one just one line
'''


"""
This is comment
written in
more than just one line
"""

print("Hey!!, you have made a multi-line comment in above line of code")

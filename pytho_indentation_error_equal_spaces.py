#program to understand python indentation

'''
The number of spaces is upto you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

if 5>2:
    print("Five is grater than two!!") #one space
if 7>2:
      print("Seven is grater than two!!") #Four Spaces
'''


'''
You have to use same number of spaces in the same block of code, other wise python will give you an error

'''

if 5>2:
    print("Five is grater than two!!") #one space
        print("Seven is grater than two!!") #Four Spaces, so execution leads to indentation error
